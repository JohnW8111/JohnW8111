Hello, I'm John, a family physician by profession and a lifelong learner. During my life, I've dedicated significant time to working with healthcare systems globally. I've employed a framework known as the Triple Aim, which focuses on three goals: improving population health, enhancing healthcare experiences, and managing per capita healthcare costs. My work in health systems has involved substantial innovation and research. Here's a link to the basic approach I and others have used: [IHI Innovation System.](https://www.ihi.org/resources/white-papers/ihi-innovation-system)

Since the beginning of 2023, I've embarked on a new journey, learning Python programming. I use Replit for coding and have completed the Fast AI introductory course. This course enabled me to develop a machine learning model capable of identifying skin cancer. Like many others, I've utilized ChatGPT in various areas. I've created some GPTs and also developed an assistant program using the OpenAI Assistant API. This project marks my first repository on GitHub.
